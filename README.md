# Process Scheduling Algorithm Simulator (C++)

This project simulates popular **CPU scheduling algorithms** used in Operating Systems. It helps visualize how processes are scheduled, how turnaround time and waiting time are calculated, and gives insight into how operating systems manage CPU time.

## Supported Algorithms

1. **FCFS (First-Come First-Serve)**
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
   - Non-Preemptive
   - Preemptive (also called SRTF)
3. **Priority Scheduling**
   - Non-Preemptive
   - Preemptive
4. **Round Robin**
   - With configurable time quantum
